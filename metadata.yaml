description: '"Today, Thomas Dixon is perhaps best known as the author of the best-selling
  early twentieth-century trilogy that included the novel The Clansman (1905), which
  provided the core narrative for D.W. Griffith''s groundbreaking and still-controversial
  film The Birth of a Nation . It was The Sins of the Father, however, that Dixon
  regarded as the most aesthetically satisfying child of his Ku Klux Klan saga. In
  this novel he telescopes the trilogy''s sprawling historical canvas into one tightly
  scripted narrative. A best-seller in 1912, the novel''s themes of interracial sex
  and incest outraged many.'
